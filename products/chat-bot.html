  <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-#1">
    The ChatBot has two main elements: the Bot and a messaging agent.
  </p>

  <h3 class="entry-title">
    <p data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-bot-header">Bot</p>
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-#2">
    The Bot is a software application designed and programmed to perform specific tasks in an automated manner. This
    means that it can run according to your instructions without the need for manual intervention by a human user. Bots
    are especially useful for carrying out repetitive tasks and can perform them faster and more efficiently than
    people.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-#3">
    In the context of the ChatBot, the Bot is the main component that interacts with customers. It is programmed to
    understand and respond to inquiries, provide information, carry out transactions and offer general support. The Bot
    uses algorithms and natural language processing techniques to understand context and provide relevant and accurate
    responses.
  </p>
  <h3 class="entry-title">
    <p data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-agent-header">Courier Agent</p>
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-#4">
    The Messenger Agent is the tool that allows your customer service team to track and verify customer data and
    interactions with the Bot. It is an application with an intuitive interface that facilitates the management and
    supervision of the conversations between the Bot and the clients.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-#5">
    The Messenger Agent provides your customer service team with a complete view of customer interactions with the Bot.
    It allows you to review conversations, get additional information, answer specific questions and provide concrete
    actions beyond the capabilities of the Bot. With this tool, your team can step in and provide personalized
    assistance when needed, improving the customer experience and solving more complex problems.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-#6">
    In short, the ChatBot consists of an automated bot that interacts with customers to provide answers and perform
    tasks, and a messenger agent that allows your customer service team to follow up and provide additional assistance.
    This combination of elements improves efficiency, personalized attention and customer satisfaction by providing fast
    and accurate responses, as well as human intervention when necessary.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="section-products-chat-bot-#7">
    There are two great beneficiaries in the implementation of our ChatBot: your clients and your institution.
